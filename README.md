- Save the enabled addons in the current addon list as a addon loading scheme, and then you can enable any scheme with one click, and up to 30 schemes are supported
- You can set serval load condition with every addon loading scheme, when meet condition, this addon will display a pop-up dialog to remind you
- Add remark for each addon

**Since you may create multiple addon loading schemes, it will cause a certain logical confusion when multiple addon schemes are met at the same time, so there is a certain priority among multiple addon schemes, you don’t need to know how it works, but an explanation may be able to help you Provide a little help**

- When you check the pop-up prompt, the priority of the addon scheme will be significantly increased
- The priority of the role-specific scheme will be higher than that of the global scheme, and much higher
- The loading condition group and the group do not affect each other, and only the addon scheme that meets multiple sets of conditions at the same time will be regarded as meeting the conditions
- The more options selected in the group, the lower the priority. For example: Two exactly the same schemes, the scene type in the loading condition of scheme A is checked for world, and the scene type of the loading condition for scheme B is checked for world and the battleground, then when the two schemes meet the conditions at the same time, the priority of the A scheme will be ranked first
